        I am a Telematics Engineer with over nine years of experience building
        full-stack web applications using JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and C#.
        My expertise includes backend development with Node.js (Express.js, NestJS)
        and frontend frameworks like React/Redux and Svelte. I&apos;ve worked with
        IBM Cloud technologies, including Kafka-based Event Streams and NoSQL databases.

      <p>
        Recently, I&apos;ve focused on maintaining and modernizing a legacy enterprise
        application—resolving bugs, implementing new features, and leading its migration
        to a React-based architecture. I also provide direct user support, ensuring
        system reliability and continuous improvement.

      <p>
        My strengths include modular problem-solving, fast learning, clear communication,
        and a strong drive for personal and professional growth.
